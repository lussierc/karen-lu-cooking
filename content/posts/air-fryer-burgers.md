# Air Fryer Burger

*Ingredients:*

* *1lb lean ground beef* 
* 1/4 cup finely diced onion
* 1/2 cup shredded cheese 
* 2 garlic cloves diced
* 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce 
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 1 egg

*Directions:*

*Combine all ingredients in bowl. Form 4 equal size patties and put indentation in center with thumb (this helps hold the shape of the patty). Cook in preheated airfryer at 350 for 5 minutes. Flip and cook an additional 5-7 minutes until temp is 150 or above.*

*Notes: Can be frozen, defrost before cooking.  Also all airfryers varying in cooking time. Also great on grill!*
