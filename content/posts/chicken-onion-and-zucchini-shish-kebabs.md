This recipe can be made as a shish kebab or in a grill pan.  Combine ginger, soy sauce, garlic and pepper, add diced chicken and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Drain chicken reserving marinade.  Alternate chicken, vegetables and lemon slices on skewers. Sprinkle with lemon juice. Baste with reserved marinade and sprinkle with oil. Grill until chicken cooked through.  Alternatively add chicken and vegetables to an oiled grill wok or pan and grill stirring occassionally until cooked through.

No grill, no problem!  Place kebabs on oiled cookie sheet and broil 6 minutes from top element- turning skewers over once and brushing with marinade twice.
