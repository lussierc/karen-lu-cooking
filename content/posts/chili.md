# Chili

*Ingredients:*

* 2 lbs ground beef
* 1 cup chopped onion
* 1 cup chopped peppers, any kind
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 28 oz can crushed tomatoes (see note)
* 28 oz  can pinto beans, drained
* 16 oz can kidney beans, undrained
* 2 TB chili powder
* 1 heaping tsp cumin powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* a few drops of your favorite hot sauce, optional

*Directions:*

Brown ground meat with onion and pepper, drain fat and put in crockpot. Add remaining ingredients, stir and cover.  Cook on low 7-8 hours.  We typically eat this over rice and topped with cheese, onion and additional hot sauce to taste.  \
NOTES: You can use any kind of canned tomatoes from crushed, whole peeled, diced, to diced with chilies.  You can also use any combination of beans just be sure to use some of the liquid from the beans.  Add a can of corn, drained to stretch this meal a little further, my grandma used to call this Chili Con Carne.
