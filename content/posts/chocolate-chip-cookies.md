# Chocolate Chip Cookies

No need to bring butter to room temperature!

*Ingredients:*

* 1 cup butter (use butter)
* 1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 egg yolk
* 1 TB vanilla 
* 3 cups flour (whisk before measuring)
* 1 tsp baking soda
* scant 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 3/4 cups chocolate chips

Directions:

Preheat oven to 375 and line baking sheets with parchment or silcone liners.

Start by melting butter, add melted butter to brown sugar in bowl and stir until well combined by hand. Let rest 5 minutes.  Add egg, yolk, and vanilla.  Next add flour, baking soda and salt and stir by hand until just combined.  Finally stir in chocolate chips - this will be hard to stir but be sure to incorporate all chips into dough.

Use a small scoop about 1 & 1/2 tablespoon and place on cookie sheet, using back of scoop to slightly flatten cookie. Bake for 7 1/2 minutes or until cookies are lightly golden brown on edges and centers still look soft.  Let cool for 4 minutes and then remove to wire rack.

Makes about 3 dozen.
