## The Perfect Omelette:

By no means, am I a good chef, but one area I think I excel in is the art of omelette making (outside of the flipping part).

### Ingredients:

* 3 eggs
* Milk or whipping cream
* Butter (optional)
* Spices (salt & peper)
* Sliced Onion
* Meat of your choosing (ham or bacon)
* Cheese of your choosing
* Spinach
* Diced Tomatos

### Cooking:

* First heat up your pan, on low-medium heat.
* While the pan heats up, whisk your eggs together in a bowl. Add a little bit (3-4 tblspoons) along with some salt and pepper, then complete your whisking.
* If you wish, I recommend putting a little butter in the pan, about 3/4 a tablesoon. Distribute it evenly across the pan.
* Add your whisked egg mixture.
* Cook for 3-4 minutes on low-medium heat. Monitor it to make sure it is cooking evenly.
* Then, flip the omlette, let it cook for a couple minutes.
* As it cooks: add your onion, spinach, meat, diced tomatos, cheese, and whatever other omelette ingredients your heart desires to the top of the omelette.

  * Keep it mostly in the middle of the omelette.
* If you want, add some extra cheese. If your omelette is fully cooked, turn off the heat, then put the lid on top to steam it for a little bit to melt the cheese.
* Fold your omelette up & take it out of the pan.
* Add hot sauce & enjoy.
