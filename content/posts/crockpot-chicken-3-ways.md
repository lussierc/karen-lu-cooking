# Crockpot Chicken - 3 ways

Notes: These recipes can be made using frozen or fresh boneless, skinless, chicken breasts. Cooking times will vary depending on your crockpot- I have a Bella Crockpot and frozen chicken takes 3-4 hours and fresh takes 2 to 3 on low. Chicken should be cooked until it reaches 165 degrees.

## Buffalo

*Ingredients:*

* 1 1/2 - 2 pounds boneless, chicken breasts
* 1.5 ounce packet dry shredded ranch dressing mix
* 1 cup hot sauce (Frankâ€™s)
* 1/2 cup chicken stock
* 2 TB butter

Directions:

Add chicken breasts, sprinkle ranch dressing on top of chicken and pour hot sauce and chicken over top.  Turn the chicken over a few times in the liquid. Cook on low, see suggested times listed in notes.  When cooked, remove chicken and shred using 2 forks or a hand mixer.  Put chicken back into liquid, add butter and stir to combine.  Reduce heat to warm and eat when ready.  This can be eaten on top of salads, wraps, sandwiches, etc.

Serve with tortillas over rice or salad.
