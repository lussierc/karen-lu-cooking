# Easy Minestrone Soup

*Ingredients*

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 carrot, peeled and diced
* 1 celery stalk, diced
* 1 zucchini, diced
* 1 cup fresh or frozen green beans or okra or soup veg. mix, or mixed vegetables 
* 2 (14 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
* 4 cups vegetable, beef or chicken broth
* 2 cups water
* 1 (14 ounce) can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 cup small pasta
* 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon dried basil
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1 to 11/2 cups diced ham (optional)
* Parmesan cheese-optional, for garnish

Directions:

1. Heat olive oil in a large stockpot. Add onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until lightly browned.Add in zucchini, green beans, and diced tomatoes. Stir in vegetable broth and water. Add beans, macaroni, oregano, and basil. Simmer until vegetables and macaroni are tender-about 35 minutes. 

2. Add ham and season soup with salt and pepper and serve warm. Garnish with parmesan cheese, if desired.

Notes: This soup is easy customizable to preference and what you have on hand. Mix and match vegetables and beans.  I sometimes add a small can of V-8 for flavor.
