# Ham and Cheesy Potato Casserole 

*Ingredients:*

* *4 cups diced potatoes* 
* 3 cups of broccol, cauliflower and/or peas
* 2 cups diced ham
* 1/2 cup cheddar cheese (good quality)
* panko bread crumbs to top

*Cheese sauce:*

* *1/4 cup minced onion*
*  *6 TB butter*
* 6 TB white flour
* scant 1/2 tsp salt
* 3/4 black pepper
* 2 1/2 cups milk
* 1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese (like Cabot Sharp)
* a little bit of Parmesan cheese, garlic powder to taste

*Directions:*

*Preheat oven to 350*

Parboil the diced potatoes for 5 minutes, adding the broccoli and cauliflower the last minute. Drain when done and leave covered in pan.  Start the cheese sauce by melting the butter, then add onion and saut√© for 3 minutes to soften but not brown.  Mix the flour, salt and pepper together and add to the butter stirring constantly for 3-4 minutes.  Add the milk a little at the time while constantly whisking- continue to cook (about 8-10 minutes) until the sauce thickens.  If too thick add a little more milk to thin. Once thickened remove from heat and stir in the cheese and other spices.  

Stir the potatoes, vegetables, and ham into the cheese sauce. Pour into a prepared 9 by 13 casserole dish and top with bread crumbs and cheese. Bake in a 350 oven uncovered for 30 minutes.  Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
