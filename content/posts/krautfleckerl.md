# Krautfleckerl 

*Ingredients:*

* *12-14 ounces wide egg noodles, reserve 1 cup cooking water*
* 12 ounces bacon, cut into bit sized pieces
* 7 ounces diced ham
* 2 TB olive oil
* 1-2 large onions, thinly sliced
* 4 cups shredded cabbage (soak cabbage 1 hour in water to sweeten)
* 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
* Salt and pepper

*Directions:*

Cook bacon in large skillet until almost crisp and then add diced ham to pan and continue to cook until both are slightly crispy.  Remove from pan leaving behind fat and add olive oil and onion.  Cook over medium low heat, covered and stirring occasionally about 15 until onions are soft and browned.  Cook egg noodles according to package directions while onions are cooking.  Add cabbage to onions and cook for 5 minutes or until soft.  Add cooked noodles, bacon and ham, Parmesan chees, salt and pepper to taste.  Stir to combine and add reserved pasta water if the mixture is too dry.  Enjoy!  The leftovers taste even better the next day!
