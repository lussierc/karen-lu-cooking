# Oven Baked Buffalo Chicken Tenders

***Ingredients:***

* 1 lb chicken tenders
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs (see recipe for homemade bread crumb)
* 1/3 cup Parmesan Cheese
* 1/4 tsp each of garlic powder and paprika
* pinch of salt, pepper and cayenne pepper

*Directions:*

   Preheat oven to 425. In a large bag, combine the flour, panko, parmesan cheese, and seasonings. Shake well to combine. \
  Pat chicken tenders dry and dip them in egg mixture. Working in batches, add tenders to bag. Seal bag and shake until tenders are thoroughly coated.\
  Place breaded tenders on  greased cookie sheet.  Add additional bread crumb mixture if necessary to ensure tenders are fully coated.  Bake 5 minutes, flip tenders and bake another 5 minutes.\
  Remove tenders from oven and place in large bowl. Cover with wing sauce and toss until evenly coated. Return to baking sheet and bake an additional 5 minutes, or until tenders reach 160 degrees.
