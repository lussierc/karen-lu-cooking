Dice chicken into bite sized pieces, toss chicken with taco seasoning. Melt butter in skillet over medium heat and add chicken, onion and pepper.  Cook until all sides of chicken are brown about 5 minutes, add can of tomatoes and cook about 3-4 minutes until chicken is cooked through. In the meantime,  spray a 9 by 13 baking dish with cooking spray, place taco shells in pan, add about a tablespoon of refried beans (serve remaining beans with dinner) to each shell and spread.  Fill each taco with chicken mixture, top with cheese and bake for 5-7 minute*.*

Serve immediately (they get soggy fast) and top as you please.
