# Skillet Pierogies, Ham and Veggies 

*Ingredients:*

* Olive Oil
* Frozen Pierogies - flavor and brand of your choosing (I like Mrs. Tâ€™s)
* Onion, sliced
* Bell peppers, sliced
* Any other veggies you like - zucchin, broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes spinach, etc - cut into bite size pieces
* Ham, sliced in thin strips 
* season salt and pepper
* garlic powder
* optional sour cream or applesauce 

*Directions:*

I scale this recipe to the number of people I am serving typically 4-5 Pierogies per person.  Add enough oil to coat bottom of skillet and heat over medium heat- add Pierogies and lightly season with seasonings.  Add in all vegetables except spinach and cook for 8 minutes.  Flip Pierogies over and lightly season again and cook for 6 minutes.  Add spinach and ham and heat through for about 2 minute.  Serve with sour cream or applesauce*.*
