# Southwest Barley Chicken Chili



## Ingredients:

* 1 Can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes, undrained or tomatoes with diced chilies
* 1 jar(s) (16 oz) salsa
* 2 cups chicken broth
* 1 Cup Quaker Quick Barley
* 3 1/2 Cups Water
* 1 - 2 Tablespoon chili powder
* 1 Teaspoon Cumin
* 1 4oz. Can diced chilies
* salt and pepper to taste
* 1 Can (15 oz) Black Beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 Can(s) (15 oz) corn, drained
* 3 Cup(s) (about 1-1/2 lbs) chicken breast, cooked, cut into bite-sized pieces
* Shredded cheese (optional)
* sour cream (optional), chopped onions, and cilantro

Directions:

Add first 8 ingredients and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low for about 20 minutes (until barley is tende) stirring occasionall.  Add remaining ingredients and bring back to a low boil for at least 5 minutes.  The longer this chili rests the more liquid and thicker the chili will become— add chicken broth or water to thin if necessary.

Serve with desired toppings and additional hot sauce as desired.
