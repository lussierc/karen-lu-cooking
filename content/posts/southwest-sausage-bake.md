# Southwest Sausage Bake

*In*gredients

* *6+ fajita sized flour tortillas, cut into strips*
* 2-3 (4 oz) cans chopped green chilies
* 1 pound ground pork sausage, cook & drain
* 2 cups shredded Mexican cheese (any flavor)
* 10 eggs (more if needed)
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1/2 tsp each of salt, garlic powder, onion powder,black pepper, and ground cumin 
* Paprika to top
* 2 sliced medium tomatoes

Serve with sour cream, salsa, and hot sauce

*Directions:*

In a greased 9 by 13 baking dish, layer half of cut strips, so they fill bottom of pan without too much overlap- I cut as I go so as not to cut more than needed- spread chiles, sausage and cheese on top, repeat with another layer. Beat eggs, milk and spices until smooth and pour over top.  If your liquid mixture doesn’t completely cover the layers, add more egg and milk to the bowl. Sprinkle top with paprika. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat oven to 350 and bring casserole to room temperature. Bake, uncovered for 45 to 50 minutes. Arrange tomato slices on top and bake another 10 minutes or longer until a knife inserted near center comes out clean. Rest for 10 minutes and serve.

Enjoy! A Easter and Christmas tradition for us but also makes a great dinner!
