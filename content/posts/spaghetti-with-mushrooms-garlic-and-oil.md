* 3 TBS parsley, chopped (optional)
* fresh ground pepper

Heat olive oil in skillet over medium low heat, add garlic and red pepper flake. Stir for 1 minute until fragrant.  Add mushrooms and salt and cook until mushrooms release liquid and soften.  Takes about 5 minutes.  Cook spaghetti in salted water following directions on box, reserve about 1 cup of cooking water, drain and toss with mushrooms.
