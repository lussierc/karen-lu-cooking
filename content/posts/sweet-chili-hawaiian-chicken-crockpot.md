# Sweet Chili Hawaiian Crockpot Chicken

*Ingredients:*

* 2 1/2 pounds frozen boneless, skinless, chicken breast
* 1 bottle Sweet Chili Sauce (330 grams)
* 1 16-20 oz can pineapple chunks in own juice
* 2 TB cornstarch 
* 1 20 oz bag of frozen stir fry vegetables or a mixture of 6 cups of fresh vegetables cut into bite size pieces

*Directions:*

Place frozen chicken in crockpot and pour Sweet Chili Sauce and pineapple chunks and juice over chicken.  Cover and cook over low until temperature reaches 165 (4-5 hours depending on size of chicken and crockpot).  Remove chicken and slice, return slices to crockpot.  Mix cornstarch with a little cold water until well-blended and mix into crockpot.  Add fresh vegetables and cook for another 45 minutes.  If using frozen vegetables (my preference), microwave until crisp and add to crockpot and cook for another 10- 15 minutes.  Serve over rice.
