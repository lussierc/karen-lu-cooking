Turkey and Veggie Bolognese 

*Ingredients:*

* 1 pound ground turkey 
* 1 TB olive oil
* 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 bell pepper, chopped
* 1 cup zucchini, chopped (optional)
* 1 14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes 
* 1 15 oz can tomato sauce
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1/2 tsp dried basil
* 1 to 2 tsp chili paste, to taste (optional)
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, (optional)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 cup orzo pasta, gf if necessary- see note
* 2 cups chicken broth
* 1/2 cup Parmesan Cheese

*Directions:*

Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium heat, add turkey and cook while breaking apart. Drain fat. Add onion, pepper and zucchini and cook until softene. Add garlic and cook for one minute until fragrant.

Pour in can of diced tomatoes and tomato sauce and then add oregano, basil, chili paste, red pepper, salt and pepper. Stir and bring to a simmer for 15 minutes, continuing to stir occasionally.

If using orzo, add to sauce along with chicken broth.  Ensure orzo is covered with liquid if not added more chicken broth. Bring back to a simmer, reduce heat to low and cover and cook for 15-20 minutes until orzo is tender and liquid is absorbed. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

Remove from heat and add Parmesan cheese if using.

Note: This is equally good used to top pasta like penne or bow ties- just add one cup of chicken broth (or more if you want a thinner sauce) and omit the orzo.

You can also add more vegetables like spinach and fresh tomatoes.  This receipe is a base that can be adapted to taste and ingredients on hand.
